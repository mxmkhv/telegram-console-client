A terminal-based Telegram client for technical users.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g telegram-console
```

## Setup

### Step 1: Get Telegram API Credentials

Telegram allows third-party clients to access their platform through an official API. Unlike some services that require centralized API keys, Telegram's model lets each user generate their own credentials. This means:

- **You control your credentials** — your API ID and Hash are generated by you and stored only on your machine
- **No middleman** — this client connects directly to Telegram's servers using your credentials
- **Full transparency** — the code is open source, so you can verify exactly what data is sent

To get your credentials:

1. Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/auth) and log in with your phone number
2. You'll receive a confirmation code in Telegram — enter it
3. Click on **"API development tools"**
4. Fill in the form:
   - **App title**: Any name (e.g., "My Console Client")
   - **Short name**: A short identifier (e.g., "console")
   - Platform, description, and other fields can be left as default
5. Click **"Create application"**
6. You'll see your **API ID** (a number) and **API Hash** (a string) — save these

> **Important**: Never share your API credentials. They are unique to your account and should be treated like a password.

By using the Telegram API, you agree to Telegram's [API Terms of Service](https://core.telegram.org/api/terms).

### Step 2: Run the Client

1. Run `telegram-console`
2. Enter your API ID and API Hash when prompted
3. Authenticate using one of these methods:
   - **QR Code** (default): Scan the QR code with Telegram mobile app (Settings → Devices → Link Desktop Device)
   - **Phone Code**: Enter your phone number and the code sent to your Telegram
